istanbul 1.x APIs (with full sourcemap support) to report coverage.\n\n## About\nThis is a reporter only and does not perform the actual instrumentation of your code. Babel users should use the [istanbul babel plugin](https://github.com/istanbuljs/babel-plugin-istanbul) to instrument your code and webpack + typescript users should use the [istanbul-instrumenter-loader](https://github.com/deepsweet/istanbul-instrumenter-loader) and then use this karma reporter to do the actual reporting. See the [test config](https://github.com/mattlewis92/karma-coverage-istanbul-reporter/blob/master/test/karma.conf.js) for an e2e example of how to combine them.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\nnpm install karma-coverage-istanbul-reporter --save-dev\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\n```js\n// karma.conf.js\nconst path = require('path');\n\nmodule.exports = function (config) {\n\n  config.set({\n\n    // ... rest of karma config\n\n    // anything named karma-* is normally auto included so you probably dont need this\n    plugins: ['karma-coverage-istanbul-reporter'],\n\n    reporters: ['coverage-istanbul'],\n\n    // any of these options are valid: https://github.com/istanbuljs/istanbuljs/blob/aae256fb8b9a3d19414dcf069c592e88712c32c6/packages/istanbul-api/lib/config.js#L33-L39\n    coverageIstanbulReporter: {\n\n      // reports can be any that are listed here: https://github.com/istanbuljs/istanbuljs/tree/aae256fb8b9a3d19414dcf069c592e88712c32c6/packages/istanbul-reports/lib\n      reports: ['html', 'lcovonly', 'text-summary'],\n\n      // base output directory.
